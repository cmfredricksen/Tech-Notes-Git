<h3>This page is based on my own notes while learning Git & GitHub.</h3>

<p>To get started follow the links above.</p>
<p>
  In order to learn, I practiced the steps over and over again. I made a new
  project folder, and then initiated git, then I made my online repo and
  connected it to my local one. I tried to make regular commits and push them to
  my online repo, though I was inconsistent as a beginner. I went through the
  steps several times until it became pretty easy. After that I moved to
  branches, followed by GitHub pages. I did not need to do all of these things
  at the time, it was just practicing to get the muscle memory going.
</p>
<p>I hope this is useful for you. Don't give up, you'll get it!</p>

<p>
  There are several sources of good information on Git and GitHub, but the best
  way to learn is by doing. When I started trying to learn about version control
  it was hard for me to wrap my head around it. So the first source I am going
  to share is a series of YouTube videos by The Coding Train that helped me
  understand it a little better, while keeping it fun.

<h3>Additional Commands:</h3>

<p>To see hidden files, including your git repo type in:</p>
<p class="code-box">dir /ah</p>
<p>Shows a log of commits for the current repo:</p>
<p class="code-box">git log</p>
<p>Combine commands to be more efficient, two examples below:</p>
<p class="code-box">git add -A && git commit -m "message about commit"</p>
<p class="code-box">git init && git add -A && git commit -m "initial commit"</p>

<p>To exit the git log you can type either "q" or "z"</p>

  <li>GitHub: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.</li>
